# lox-rs

A quick n dirty implementation of the Lox language, according to the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) in rust. 

This is my cutting-teeth intro to Rust, from real code and first principles. All omissions and errors are mine.

You can see a list of [TODOs](./todo.md) as well.
